# MATH30000 Double Project

Welcome to the repository for my final year project, "Variable Selection in Regression Analysis," completed during my degree at the University of Manchester. Under the guidance of Dr. Christiana Charalambous, I achieved a first-class result for this project.

## Project Description

This project explores the crucial topic of variable selection in regression analysis. Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical technique used in various fields, and selecting the right variables can significantly impact the model's accuracy and interpretability. Throughout this project, I delved into various methods, algorithms, and strategies for effective variable selection in regression analysis.
